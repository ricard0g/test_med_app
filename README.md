# Medical Appointment Booking Website - Front-End Capstone Project

This is my final project for the IBM Front-End Professional Certificate.

### What is the project about?

**Stay Healthy** is a website that connects patients that don't have a Medical Professional nearby that's able to help them with any medical issue.

By using this website they can directly contact and even chose which professional to talk to. They can schedule an appointment to talk about any issue they may have and be able to hopefully solve that problem and stay healthy.

### Features

- See which professionals on the field you need are available Online

- Schedule an appointment with the professional you've selected
